## What is Wizzard PHP ?

Wizzard-PHP is a PHP library that allows you to create a website with ease.
It's a librairy to focus on the backend of your website, and a bit on the front-end.

The goal with this librairy is to provide tools to make harder work a bit easier.
One of the goal is to let the dev use an MVC architecture if he wants or maybe just MV, M, V or none.

Functionalities such as :
- MVC
  - Routing (TODO)
  - Templating (TODO)
  - Entity (TODO)
- Form generation (WIP)
- Form validation (TODO)
- CRUD (TODO)
- API (TODO)
- User
  - Authentication (TODO)
  - Session Recovery (TODO)
- Image gestion (TODO Maybe)
  - Download
  - Upload
  - Resize
  - Name (avoid weird letters)

## Installation

To install it, you only need to unzip it in your root folder of your project. 
(a way to be sure is that the file "spellDispatcher.php" is in the same folder as your index.php)
